## 📦 Installation

To run locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vivekvardhan7/Tripwise.git
cd Tripwise
npm install
npm run dev
Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

🧪 How It Works
User logs in via Clerk.

User enters preferences (e.g., "beach vacation in South India for 5 days").

Gemini AI processes the query and generates a daily itinerary.

Firebase stores user data and preferences.

Geoapify displays locations on an interactive map.

Unsplash fetches high-quality images for each place.

### ✅ Tips:
- Add your **project screenshots** to `/assets` folder and link them properly.
- If you're using environment variables (e.g. API keys), create a `.env.example`.
- Want a badge-styled header (e.g. Vercel deployed)? Let me know!

Would you like me to generate the actual `.md` file or include badges like `Made with React`, `Powered by Gemini`,
